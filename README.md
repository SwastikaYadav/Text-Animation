## What is Hacktoberfest 2020? 💻

Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Participation Rules 👀

To get a shirt, you must make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any time zone. Pull requests can be to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports behavior that’s not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

## First Contribution 🤝🏻

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. I wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

## Create Your First Pull Request 🔗

1. [Star and Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

2. Do some changes on this [Text Animation webpage](https://upasanadeka.github.io/Text-Animation/) using HTML/CSS/JS.

For starters,

- You can add a location input and display the location of the user
